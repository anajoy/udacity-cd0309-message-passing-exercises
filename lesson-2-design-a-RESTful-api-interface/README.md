#### Design a RESTful API Interface Task List

### Task:
We want to implement the following functionality:

Place an order for a computer
Get all computer orders
When a user orders a computer, we want to allow users to specify equipment such as a keyboard or a webcam to include with the order.

An order should contain information on the user who created the order, the status of the order, the time the order was placed, and additional equipment.

- Create an API endpoint for placing an order for a computer: include the request headers, request body, and request URL, response code, and response body.

- Create an API endpoint for retrieving a list of all computer orders that have been placed: include the request headers, request body, request URL, response code, and response body.
